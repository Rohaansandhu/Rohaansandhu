## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Rohaan

I'm a Computer Science student at UC San Diego with a strong focus on backend and full-stack development. I enjoy exploring new tools and technologies to build scalable, user-focused software.

### ðŸ‘· Current Work 
----------------------------
I'm building a data pipeline that processes 10,000+ congressional roll call votes and bills, using LLMs to classify bill summaries with partisan and impact scores to create political stance profiles of US Congress members. With this project, I'm hoping to make Congress more transparent and help voters understand the policy positions of their current representatives.

I'm also developing a local-first mobile application with Flutter that syncs workout data across devices using Supabase authentication and cloud storage while maintaining offline functionality through SQLite. So far, itâ€™s been a great way to strengthen my backend architecture skills while improving my UI/UX design and frontend workflow.

### ðŸ’» Previous Experience
----------------------------
Previously, I held an internship at GEI Consultants Inc. where I contributed to the Corps Water Management System (CWMS), a mission-critical platform used by the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers to manage water resources. This project strengthened my skills in Java, SQL, and API development.

### ðŸ¤– Robotics
----------------------------
I was the Software Scouting Backend Lead at [FRC Team 1678](https://www.citruscircuits.org/) for 2 years, where I led the development of the scouting system. If you're curious, please check out our [public repository](https://github.com/frc1678/server-2024-public) and [whitepaper](https://www.citruscircuits.org/uploads/6/9/3/4/6934550/whitepaper_2024_-_final.pdf) for the 2024 season.
